### Features

##### Google Sheets as a Database
You don't have to use those ugly Google Forms. Create your own and add rows to the form results to a Google Sheets.

This is good for collecting addresses for invitations or taking RSVPs.

See the demo's [Google Sheet database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jSKirsg20c9LosNP1KLhoo6TKnoyLXm5GyHWkSwamyw/edit?usp=sharing).

##### Travis CI/CD with GH Pages
Easily host your site via Github when you push to master. Just make sure to create a token and add a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to your Travis repo settings so that Travis has permissions to push to the `gh-pages` branch.
